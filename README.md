# Heart-Disease-Prediction-

Heart disease is one of the biggest causes of morbidity and mortality among the population of the world. Prediction of cardiovascular disease is regarded as one of the most important subjects in the section of clinical data analysis. The amount of data in the healthcare industry is huge. Data mining turns the large collection of raw healthcare data into information that can help to make informed decisions and predictions.

Our problem is that we want to predict whether patients have heart disease by given some features of users. This is important to medical fields. If such a prediction is accurate enough, we can not only avoid wrong diagnosis but also save human resources.When a patient without a heart disease is diagnosed with heart disease, he will fall into unnecessary panic and when a patient with heart disease is not diagnosed with heart disease, he will miss the best chance to cure his disease. Such wrong diagnosis is painful to both patients and hospitals. With accurate predictions, we can solve the unnecessary trouble.

We are using Decision Tree and is deployed using Heroku.
A decision tree is a type of supervised machine learning used to categorize or make predictions based on how a previous set of questions were answered.
